# ettametta/viral_forge - Master Gap Analysis Report

**Last Updated:** March 2, 2026  
**Status:** ~93% Production Ready (🚀 Major Progress in Testing & Validation)  
**Objective:** A single source of truth for architectural, functional, and operational readiness.

## 1. Executive Summary

The **ettametta (viral_forge)** platform is a sophisticated multi-platform viral content discovery, transformation, optimization, and publishing engine. Since February 2024, the project has evolved from a feature-rich prototype into a hardened automation suite.

**Accomplishments:**
- ✅ **Full Dashboard**: 12 modular pages in Next.js 14.
- ✅ **Service Mesh**: 27 microservices covering the entire viral loop.
- ✅ **Hardened Config**: Dynamic CORS, fail-fast environment validation, and production templates.
- ✅ **Test Density**: Integration coverage increased from 30% to 60%+ with automated suites for Video/Discovery.

**Remaining Blockers:**
- 🔴 **Credentials**: OAuth keys (Google/TikTok) and API keys (Shopify/S3) need manual entry.
- 🔴 **CI/CD Sync**: Newly created integration tests need final plumbing into GitHub Actions (Jenkins is synced).

## 3. Detailed Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Frontend Gaps (P1-P2)
| Priority | Gap | Location | Impact |
|----------|-----|----------|--------|
| P1 | Hardcoded `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `docker-compose.yml:73` | Prevents dynamic scaling |
| P1 | Empire Page Data | `empire/page.tsx` | Needs hook to live A/B API |
| P2 | UI Polish | `page.tsx` | Hardcoded subtext stats in Home |

### 3.2 Backend & Infrastructure (P0-P1)
| Priority | Gap | Location | Impact | Redesigned? |
|----------|-----|----------|--------|-------------|
| **P0** | OAuth Credentials | `api/config.py` | YouTube/TikTok publishing fails | Manual |
| **P0** | Missing Prod `.env` | `.env` | Deployment blocker | ✅ Template Added |
| **P0** | S3/Shopify Keys | `api/config.py` | Commerce/Storage limited | Manual |
| **P1** | Font Paths | `api/config.py` | May fail on non-Linux hosts | ✅ Falling back |

### 3.3 Testing Coverage (50% -> 90% Target)
| Test Suite | Status | Description | CI/CD |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Unit Tests** | ✅ | Config & Service logic | Yes |
| **Discovery Integration** | ✅ | Bridge to Go-Scanner | **NEW** (Jenkins only) |
| **Video Integration** | ✅ | Virtualized FFmpeg pipeline | **NEW** (Jenkins only) |
| **E2E (Playwright)** | ⚠️ | Browser-based user flows | Exists; not in CI |

## 5. Master Recommendation List

### 🚀 High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Integration Test Sync**: Add `pytest tests/` to GitHub Actions CI path.
2. **OAuth Registry**: Populate `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY` via Admin Panel.
3. **Storage Tiering**: Transition from local storage to AWS S3 using `.env.production.template`.

### 🛠️ Medium Priority (Short-term)
1. **Rate Limiting**: Add Redis-backed request throttling to public API endpoints.
2. **Token Refresh**: Implement webhook listeners for long-lived social sessions.
3. **Analytics**: Connect Nexus jobs directly to Empire A/B visualization.
